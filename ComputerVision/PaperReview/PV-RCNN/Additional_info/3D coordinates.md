3D coordinates are a way of representing the position of a point in three-dimensional space. This is typically done using an ordered triplet of numbers (x, y, z), where:

- x represents the position along the horizontal axis,
- y represents the position along the vertical axis,
- z represents the depth or distance into or out of the page/screen.

These three values together form a coordinate system known as Cartesian coordinates. The origin (0, 0, 0) is usually considered to be at the center of this coordinate system.

In practical applications such as computer graphics and engineering design, 3D coordinates are used to model and manipulate objects in a virtual 3D environment. For example, each vertex in a 3D model would have its own set of (x,y,z) coordinates that define its exact location in space.
