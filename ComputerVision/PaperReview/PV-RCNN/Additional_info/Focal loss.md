Focal Loss is a type of loss function that was introduced in the "[Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)" paper by Tsung-Yi Lin et al. from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in 2017. It's primarily used to address the problem of class imbalance in object detection tasks.

In object detection, there are often many more negative examples (background or non-objects) than positive examples (objects of interest). This can lead to a class imbalance problem where the model becomes biased towards predicting negatives, as they dominate the training process.

The focal loss function is designed to down-weight easy examples (like negatives that are easily classified as such), and focus training on hard examples (like positives that might be missed, or negatives that get misclassified as positives). It does this by adding a modulating factor to the standard cross entropy loss.

This modulating factor is a smoothly decreasing function of the correct classification probability. If an example is easily classified, its contribution to the total loss decreases rapidly. Conversely, if an example is misclassified and hard to classify correctly, its contribution remains significant.

The focal loss has been successfully applied in object detection models like RetinaNet and has helped improve their performance on imbalanced datasets.
