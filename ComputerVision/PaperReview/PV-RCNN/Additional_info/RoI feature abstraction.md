***Region of Interest (RoI) feature abstraction*** is a technique used in various object detection algorithms, including some 3D object detection methods. It's **a method to extract features from specific regions of interest within an image or point cloud.**

The idea is to identify regions that are likely to contain objects and then focus the computation on these areas. This can make the model more efficient by avoiding unnecessary computations on irrelevant parts of the data.

In 3D object detection, RoI feature abstraction often involves selecting 3D bounding boxes (or other shapes) that are likely to contain objects. These regions are then processed further to extract high-level features, which can be used for tasks like classification (what type of object is it?) and regression (what are the precise dimensions and location of the object?).

One example of this concept in practice is in PointRCNN, a point-based method for 3D object detection from raw point cloud data. In PointRCNN, after a Region Proposal Network has proposed potential bounding boxes, RoI feature abstraction is used to gather features from each proposed region for further processing.

It's worth noting that "RoI feature abstraction" might not be referred as such in all papers or models; some might simply call it "feature extraction" or use other terminology depending on the specific techniques involved.
