MLP stands for **Multi-Layer Perceptron**, which is a type of artificial neural network. An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node (also known as a neuron) in one layer connects with a certain weight to every node in the following layer.

Here's how it works:

1. The input layer receives the raw data (the features). Each neuron in this layer corresponds to one feature.
    
2. The hidden layers perform computations on the inputs received and transfer the results to neurons in the next layer. These computations involve applying a weighted sum across inputs followed by passing this sum through an activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, or tanh.
    
3. The output layer produces the final outcomes/results of these computations for given inputs.
    

The 'learning' part in an MLP involves adjusting the weights applied to each input over multiple iterations using techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation, so that it can make accurate predictions or classifications.

It's important to note that MLPs are characterized by fully connected layers (each neuron connects to all neurons in adjacent layers) and they do not have convolutional or recurrent connections like other types of neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
