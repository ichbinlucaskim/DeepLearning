A point cloud is a collection of data points defined in a three-dimensional coordinate system. These points are usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates and often represent the external surface of an object.

Point clouds are used in various fields, such as 3D modeling, computer graphics, geospatial technology (like GIS), metrology (the science of measurement), medical imaging, and visual effects production.

In the context of autonomous driving or robotics, point clouds are often generated using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensors. These sensors send out laser pulses which bounce back after hitting objects; the time it takes for each pulse to return helps determine the distance to objects around the sensor. The resulting point cloud provides a 3D representation of the environment which can be used for navigation and object detection.
