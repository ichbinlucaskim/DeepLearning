The term "**2D bird's eye view feature maps**" refers to a representation of 3D data (such as LiDAR point clouds) projected onto a 2D plane, typically from a top-down perspective. This is often used in the context of autonomous driving and robotics.

Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection**: A LiDAR sensor collects 3D point cloud data about the surrounding environment.
    
2. **Projection**: This 3D data is then projected onto a 2D plane to create what is called a "bird's eye view" or BEV map. In this projection, each point in the original 3D space corresponds to a pixel on the BEV map. The value of each pixel might represent various attributes such as height, intensity, or density of points.
    
3. **Feature Extraction**: These BEV maps are then treated as images and fed into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features for tasks like object detection or segmentation.
    

One advantage of using bird's eye view feature maps is that they simplify the problem by reducing it from three dimensions to two while preserving important spatial relationships between objects. However, some details can be lost in this process because all points at different heights but with same x,y coordinates will be mapped onto the same pixel on the BEV map.

Examples of models that use these kinds of projections include PIXOR and Complex-YOLO which are designed for object detection tasks in autonomous driving scenarios.
