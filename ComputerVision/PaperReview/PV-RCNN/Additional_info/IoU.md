IoU stands for Intersection over Union. It's a measure used in computer vision to quantify the degree of overlap between two bounding boxes or, more generally, any two sets of areas. This metric is particularly useful in object detection and segmentation tasks where predictions need to be compared with ground truth labels.

Here's how it works:

1. The Intersection part refers to the area that the predicted bounding box (or area) and the ground truth bounding box both cover - i.e., their overlapping area.
    
2. The Union part refers to the total area covered by both the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box combined.
    

The IoU is then calculated by dividing the intersection by the union:

IoU = Area of Intersection / Area of Union

The resulting score ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- A score of 0 indicates no overlap at all between prediction and ground truth.
- A score of 1 means a perfect match - i.e., prediction and ground truth are exactly identical.
- Any score in between reflects partial overlap, with higher scores indicating better matches.

In many object detection tasks such as those using metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), a certain IoU threshold (often 0.5) is used to determine whether a prediction is considered a "match" or not.
